# Findings

Problems we hit that were structural or infrastructural: what happened, why, the fix, and the
lesson for next time. Newest first. Add an entry the moment you find one.

Template:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD: short name
**What happened:** what someone saw, with real numbers and where they came from.
**Cause:** the root cause, or "not yet known".
**Fix:** PR or issue, and whether it is merged or applied.
**Lesson:** what any session should do differently.
```

## 2026-10-05: API credit ran out and stopped all paid work
**What happened:** at 21:45 UTC Rosetta got "Your credit balance is too low" from the Anthropic
API. The provider guard turned on the provider stop (`automation_control` key `global`), which
also blocked Hamilton (a customer report at 22:15 was refused). Spend that day was $14.92, under
the app's own $20 cap, so the account balance, not the app cap, was the limit.
**Cause:** the Anthropic account balance hit zero.
**Fix:** James added $500 of credit (22:18). Adding credit does not clear the stop: an admin must
click Mark billing resolved, then Resume automation, on /admin (issue 153, step 0).
**Lesson:** after topping up credit, check the provider stop on /admin; it stays on by design.

## 2026-10-05: Public reports stopped being produced
**What happened:** no National Quarterly, Monthly Pulse or State Index report has been made since
Aug 10. `report_jobs` holds 12 finished files (Apr 7 to Aug 10, from the old runtime) and
`published_reports` has 0 rows (read-only query, 19:58 UTC).
**Cause:** the Generate button records an agent run, then stops with "render worker implementation
is pending", because nothing calls `src/lib/report-engine/assemble-and-render.ts`. No cron
schedules a quarterly or monthly report, though `src/lib/admin-queries.ts` still expects one.
**Fix:** not yet fixed or assigned.
**Lesson:** a retired runtime needs a replacement for every output it produced, and each scheduled
output needs a visible "last produced" date.

## 2026-10-05: CLAUDE.md went stale
**What happened:** CLAUDE.md told every session that all 25 reports were ready to review and send
(they are on hold) and listed OCR, provider-assisted extraction and report rendering as unbuilt
(all exist).
**Cause:** status and next steps were written into the standing-instructions file and never updated.
**Fix:** PR 122 removes the status section and adds `docs/project/` for state that changes.
**Lesson:** CLAUDE.md holds rules that stay true. Day-to-day state goes in a checkpoint.

## 2026-10-05: Offline accuracy was 96.5%, live accuracy was about 47%
**What happened:** Knox scored 96.5% (357 of 370) on a fresh Texas holdout (PR 91). A hand check of
201 live Texas fees at 22 institutions found 94 matching, 76 with no stored source, 22 wrong and
9 one-of-several (`live-tx-sample-2026-10-05.csv` in the shared files).
**Cause:** live fees include legacy imported rows with no source document and rows extracted by
older rules; the holdout only measured today's extractor on clean pages.
**Fix:** accuracy redefined on live fees (see DECISIONS); PR 119 checks live fees against their
source with `checkFeeAgainstSource`, relinks imported fees, and takes down the untraceable ones.
**Lesson:** measure what customers see. Report live accuracy on fresh random samples.

## 2026-10-05: Texar FCU showed a $50.01 overdraft fee
**What happened:** the real tiers are $5, $20 and $35; $50.01 was the balance threshold in the
label cell ("Negative from $50.01 and more | $35"). 17 live fees nationwide had the same error.
**Cause:** Knox took a figure in the label cell as the price. Darwin only checks that an amount is
plausible, so it can't catch a wrong-cell pick.
**Fix:** PR 114 (Knox rules v6, merged). Issue 115 takes down the 17 fees.
**Lesson:** a plausible amount is not a verified amount. Check the fee against its source line.

## 2026-10-05: SoFi's fee schedule was never found
**What happened:** SoFi Bank showed "web page, no fees, 13 pages ruled out" while its real schedule
is a PDF. The "13 pages" was one URL appended 13 times. 811 institutions were stuck the same way
(743 with no live fees), counted live at 18:20 UTC.
**Cause:** discovery ruled out SoFi's marketing fees page and never followed its "Fee Sheet" link;
the homepage blocks our bot.
**Fix:** PR 116 (merged): follow fee links on ruled-out pages first, add "fee sheet" as a phrase,
store each ruled-out URL once and ban it for 90 days instead of forever.
**Lesson:** a ruled-out page can still point to the right document. Rejections must expire.

## 2026-10-05: Migration files didn't match prod's history
**What happened:** 14 repo migration files had different version numbers from prod's
`supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`, 2 numbers were duplicated, and 9 hand-run files were
never recorded. Connecting Supabase's GitHub deploy would have re-run applied SQL.
**Cause:** SQL was run by hand in the SQL editor without recording history, and files were named freely.
**Fix:** PR 112 (merged) renamed the files and added `migration-version-kill`; issue 113 recorded
the 9 (prod now has 74 rows, latest 20270108000000).
**Lesson:** a hand-run migration must also record its history row. Follow the naming rule in CLAUDE.md.

## 2026-10-05: Database connection slots filled up after the upgrade
**What happened:** 17:31 UTC, "reserved for SUPERUSER" errors; 105 idle sessions from 31 app
instances held every slot.
**Cause:** Vercel freezes idle function instances, so the database client's idle timeout never fires.
**Fix:** PR 109 (merged 17:46) sets a server-side `idle_session_timeout` of 60 s on each connection.
At 18:03 UTC there were 3 idle connections and no connection-full errors since 17:35.
**Lesson:** client-side timeouts don't run on frozen serverless instances; enforce them on the server.

## 2026-10-05: Every Vercel build loaded the production database
**What happened:** ~14:51 UTC the database stopped answering. Each build prerendered about 120
data pages against prod.
**Cause:** data pages were statically prerendered at build time.
**Fix:** PR 101 (builds don't prerender data pages) and PR 102 (public API and Pro categories read
cached summaries), both merged.
**Lesson:** builds must never depend on the production database.

## 2026-10-04: The database was starved by pipeline write churn
**What happened:** the public site and admin slowed to a crawl; one-row index lookups took 15-25 s,
and the fee summary query took 60-95 s on the Micro instance.
**Cause:** parallel state lanes (since PR 69) plus a tick that rewrote every institution every
5 minutes, and each publish expiring every public cache. Root cause of the daily jams was Micro's
memory (224 MB buffers) forcing disk reads.
**Fix:** PRs 64, 76, 77 and 81 (merged); compute upgraded to Medium, after which the fee summary
query took 0.12 s.
**Lesson:** watch database load before adding pipeline parallelism.

## 2026-10-05: Fake price changes in fee history
**What happened:** 554 of 556 recorded fee "replacements" were not real price changes.
**Cause:** Hamilton recorded a change whenever a fee row was replaced, not when the price moved.
**Fix:** PR 78 (merged) records a change only for the same fee at a new amount in a newer
document; issue 95 cleaned history (687 rows to 133).
**Lesson:** a record that claims something happened must check that it did.

## 2026-10-05: Run summaries are boilerplate
**What happened:** every completed run's summary is the same stock text; James pasted it thinking
it was a repair result.
**Cause:** `agent_runs.summary` is a fixed footer; the real result is in `agent_run_steps.summary`.
**Fix:** not yet fixed or assigned.
**Lesson:** when pointing James to a run, quote the step summary.

## 2026-10-05: Discovery stopped and state memory stayed empty
**What happened:** discovery stopped at 04:41 UTC.
**Cause:** state lanes take one full pass per month, and every state's October pass had already
run on code with no state-expert step.
**Fix:** PR 84 (merged 18:02) counts only full passes that include a state-expert step.
**Lesson:** a cadence change must say how it treats passes that ran before it.

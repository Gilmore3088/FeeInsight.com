# Decisions

Newest first. Each entry: date, what was decided, who, why, and what it means for the work.
Seeded 2026-10-05 from the project's working memory; earlier decisions were not recorded here.

## 2026-10-05

**Free reports are instant; the institution report is paid and never promises a turnaround.**
James, 21:41-22:20 UTC. The request form becomes a picker: a National report (email only) and a
Fed district report (email plus district) are free and open at once; a report on one institution
against named competitors is the paid step, shown grayed out as the hook. Never promise "48 hours"
for anything free, because that puts unpaid work on James. This replaces the earlier "the report
is free" (J1) for the institution report. Built in PR 150.

**No Plausible.** James, 20:51 UTC. He doesn't use it; dormant Plausible code led a session to
ask him to set up a Plausible goal. Its script, CSP host, env var and docs are removed and
`plausible-kill` keeps them out. `trackEvent` stays as the one hook for a future provider; page
views come from Vercel Analytics and report requests are leads in /admin/leads.

**CLAUDE.md is kept current, and the project keeps a durable memory in `docs/project/`.**
James, 18:51 UTC. CLAUDE.md had gone stale (it said the 25 reports were ready to send).
Daily checkpoints, findings, decisions and a changelog now live in this folder.

**Take down live fees that can't be traced to the bank's own schedule.** James, 18:26 UTC.
Texar FCU showed a $50.01 overdraft fee that was really a balance threshold. Fees are relinked to
a stored schedule first; failures are taken down (reversible, logged), Texas and California first,
then nationwide, in small batches. Public counts must come from live data. Shipped in PR 119.

**Accuracy means live fees that match the bank's own current schedule.** James, ~18:11 UTC.
Accuracy is the share of live published fees whose amount and category match the bank's own
document, measured on fresh random live samples. Offline holdout scores don't count. The one
shared check is `checkFeeAgainstSource` in `src/lib/custom-report/source-check.ts`.

**Daily full passes in Texas and California.** James, 18:16 UTC. They run daily while more than
50 active institutions there lack a fee link; other states stay monthly. Shipped in PR 117.

**No Firecrawl.** James, ~17:24 UTC. It bills an account he didn't set up for this project.
Use plain fetches, Vercel previews, or a Remote Control session on his Mac.

**Texas and California are the first markets to fill deeply.** James, 17:48 UTC. They come
before any report is sent; every report stays on hold until its market passes the readiness gate.

**Upgrade the database to Medium.** James, ~17:05 UTC. Cost went from about $10 to about $60
a month. Revisit whether Small is enough once the pipeline cap and caching have settled.

**Turn on the Supabase GitHub link once migration history matches prod.** 2026-10-05. After it is
on, merging a migration file runs it on prod, so a PR must say if its SQL changes data. History was
aligned by PR 112 and issue 113; the link itself is James's step in Supabase settings.

**SQL James runs by hand goes in numbered GitHub issues labeled `sql-to-run`.** James, 14:40 UTC.
Each issue has a "1. Run this" block and a "2. Then check" block.

**Fix PRs may merge once green; redesigns wait for James's review.** James, 2026-10-05.

**The site must feel like a top-tier consulting experience.** James, 14:15 UTC.

**No heading or lead line may wrap one word onto its own line.** James, 17:02 UTC. PR 105 added
the global rule and the `heading-wrap-kill` guard; pages don't add their own rule.

**Never fake logs, records or numbers.** James, 06:32 UTC. Top priority. Status answers use
live database counts and a read-only query James can run himself.

**Agents never sit idle while there's a backlog, and failures are never silent.** James, 2026-10-05.

**Keep backend fixes minimal; UI work should be genuinely visual and clear.** James, 06:06 UTC.

## 2026-10-04

**Build the pipeline complete, not in bits; target 90%+ accuracy.** James, 20:12 UTC. The target
was later raised to 95% under the live-fee definition above.

**An institution publishes only with at least 3 distinct fees.** James. Shipped in PR 66.
Already-live thin institutions stay live but stay queued for re-review.

**Process one whole document at a time and move all its fees together.** James.

**Crawl each state monthly with a quarterly re-check, with a state expert agent per state.** James.
Built in PR 75 (state experts, monthly full pass, quarterly re-check).
